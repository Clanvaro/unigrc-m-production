# Overview

Unigrc is a comprehensive risk management application designed to help organizations identify, assess, and manage business risks. It provides tools for systematic risk analysis, including a visual risk matrix, robust reporting, dashboard analytics, and automated fraud detection for audit planning. The system aims to give stakeholders clear visibility into their risk posture, supporting informed decision-making and proactive risk mitigation. The business vision is to empower organizations with proactive risk management capabilities, enhancing strategic decision-making and overall resilience.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, TanStack Query, Radix UI, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. Key UI elements include a Visual Risk Matrix, Dynamic Value Chain Map, Risk Relationship Map (using React Flow), and Recharts-based Interactive Risk Heatmap. Features include wizard-based interfaces, enhanced mobile experience, enterprise UX enhancements (global Command Palette, virtualized tables, user-configurable saved filter views), and WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance. TanStack Query is configured for immediate data synchronization and comprehensive cache invalidation, with defensive data rendering patterns to prevent UI crashes. Comprehensive HTTP cache prevention is implemented across validation endpoints.

## Technical Implementations

The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript and Zod for validation. Data is stored in PostgreSQL (Render) using Drizzle ORM. Authentication is session-based with Replit Auth, role-based access control, and CSRF protection. Core data models include Processes, Risks, Controls, Action Plans, Risk Events, and Organizational Structure. Features include configurable risk aggregation, hierarchical entity selection, a process-centered validation system, document management, a 4-step Audit Planning Wizard with automated fraud detection, and soft-delete functionality. The system uses BullMQ for asynchronous job processing with automatic fallback to mock queues. A 3-layer cache prevention strategy ensures immediate UI updates after mutations.

## System Design Choices

The system operates in a single-tenant architecture, with all tenant-specific logic and database columns removed. Key modules like Control Self-Assessment (CSA) and Whistleblower have been completely removed. The system incorporates robust performance optimizations including tuned PostgreSQL connection pooling, parallel loading, client-side risk calculation, in-memory caching, compression, CDN-ready headers, extensive database indexing, and frontend lazy loading. A centralized cache invalidation architecture ensures real-time UI updates across all views. Observability and monitoring features include health checks, performance metrics, pool monitoring logs, automatic alerts, and deployment version tracking. Anti-regression protection is ensured through environment locking, ESLint, GitHub CI/CD, Playwright E2E tests, unit/integration/smoke tests, and database schema validation. The application is optimized for Replit Reserved VM deployment with specific Node.js memory limits and thread pool configurations. Authentication cache has been optimized to reduce API calls significantly.

### Performance Optimizations - Lazy Loading (Nov 2025)

**Validations Page** (Completed):
- Already implements tab-based lazy loading: Riesgos tab loads by default, Controles and Planes de Acción load only when accessed
- Each tab query uses `enabled: activeTab === "tab-name"` pattern with 30s staleTime and 5min cache

**Risks Page** (Completed):
- Implements two-tab lazy loading interface with `/api/risks/with-control-summary` endpoint
- Básica tab (default): ~230ms load time, shows core risk data without Process/Responsible/Cargo columns
- Detalle tab (lazy): +388ms for batch-relations and process-owners data (40% faster initial load)
- Uses VirtualizedTable with columnsBasic filtering for optimized rendering
